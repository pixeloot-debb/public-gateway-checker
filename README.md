## What
The [Indie References Guide](https://www.indielaunch.guide/) is a curated, priority-ordered collection of promotional strategies and techniques applicable to your upcoming indie venture. The resource is open-access and community-driven.

After launching numerous small software experiments over the years, promotional execution remained consistently weak. Strategies emerged sporadically, evaporated quickly, followed by scattered attempts, then abandonment. This repository addresses that pattern.

## Quickstart
1. Duplicate the [promo-tactics.md](promo-tactics.md) file or [clone this repo](https://github.com/techfounder/indie-launch-tactics).
2. Customize, eliminate, or adapt the strategies based on your venture and audience.
3. Execute systematically! The structured format enables tracking of attempted versus pending strategies.
4. Revenue? That's the objective, correct?

The guide and supplementary articles are accessible at [indielaunch.guide](https://www.indielaunch.guide/).
